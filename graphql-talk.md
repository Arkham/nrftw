# [fit] No *REST* for the Wicked

---

## A gentle introduction to *GraphQL*

---

# Hello!

* My name is Ju üôáüèª
* I'm an engineer at [AlphaSights](engineering.alphasights.com)
* We build ambitious apps in Ember (talk to me!)

---

## What's this GraphQL thing?

---

* A **Graph** **Q**uery **L**anguage
* Invented by Facebook in 2012, now made open
* Powers most of the Facebook iOS and Android apps

---

# *GraphQL*\*

#### \* Does not actually require a Graph

---

# A simple example

---

We have a `users` table like this one

```
+----+------+---------------+-----+-----------+
| id | name |    twitter    | age |  country  |
+----+------+---------------+-----+-----------+
|  1 | Ju   | arkh4m        |  29 | Italy     |
|  2 | Will | willrax       | 268 | Australia |
|  3 | Matz | yukihiro_matz |  50 | Japan     |
+----+------+---------------+-----+-----------+
```

---

# Get all users - Query string

```
{
  users {
    id,
    name
  }
}
```

---

# Get all users - JSON response

```
{
  "data": {
    "users": [
      { "id": "1", "name": "Ju" },
      { "id": "2", "name": "Will" },
      { "id": "3", "name": "Matz" }
    ]
  }
}
```

---

# Get one user - Query string

```
{
  user(id: 1) {
    id,
    name
  }
}
```

---

# Get one user - JSON response

```
{
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "id": "1",
      "name": "Ju"
    }
  }
}
```

---

# Create a user - Query string

```
mutation {
  user: createUser(
    name: "Tom",
    twitter: "tomdale",
    country: "USA"
  ) {
    id,
    name
  }
}
```

---

# Create a user - JSON response

```
{
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "id": "4",
      "name": "Tom"
    }
  }
}
```

---

# Error - Query string

```
mutation {
  user: createUser(
    twitter: "tomdale",
    country: "USA"
  ) {
    id,
    name
  }
}

```

---

# Error - JSON response

```
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "Field 'createUser' argument 'name' of
        type 'String!' is required but not provided."
    }
  ]
}
```

---

# Relationships
## Relationships
### Relationships


---

Now imagine we have a `company` table like this one

```
+----+-------------+---------------+
| id |    name     |     city      |
+----+-------------+---------------+
|  1 | AlphaSights | London        |
|  2 | Heroku      | San Francisco |
+----+-------------+---------------+
```

---

And we add a `company_id` to each user

```
+----+------+---------------+-----+-----------+------------+
| id | name |    twitter    | age |  country  | company_id |
+----+------+---------------+-----+-----------+------------+
|  1 | Ju   | arkham        |  29 | Italy     |          1 |
|  2 | Will | willrax       | 268 | Australia |          1 |
|  3 | Matz | yukihiro_matz |  50 | Japan     |          2 |
+----+------+---------------+-----+-----------+------------+
```

---

# Relationships - Query string

```
{
  user(id: 1) {
    id,
    name,
    company {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

---

# Relationships - JSON response

```
{
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "id": "1",
      "name": "Ju",
      "company": {
        "name": "AlphaSights"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

---

# Nested relationships - Query string

```
{
  user(id: 1) {
    id,
    name,
    company {
      name
      employees: users {
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

---

# Nested relationships - JSON response

```
{
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "id": "1",
      "name": "Ju",
      "company": {
        "name": "AlphaSights",
        "employees": [
          { "name": "Ju" },
          { "name": "Will" }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

---

# But *why* should I use it?

---

* Hierarchical
* Product-centric
* Client-specifies queries
* Backwards Compatible
* Structured, Arbitrary Code
* Application-Layer Protocol
* Strongly-typed
* Introspective

Imagine you have a `/articles` endpoint.

In the frontpage you want to display related articles.

So we just add them to the payload.

Now **every time** you call the `/articles` payload you have to pay the performance price for something you don't really care about.

# [fit] But what if you could do this?

---

```
{
  articles {
    id
    title
    excerpt
    preview_image_url
    author {
      name
    }
    relatedArticles(limit: 5) {
      title
      preview_image_url
    }
  }
}

# [fit] Hmm, okay.. But can I use it in Ember?

---

# [fit] YES
# [fit] github.com/alphasights/ember-graphql-adapter

---

# Features

* Automatic queries generation
* Field and object aliasing
* Async relationships
* BelongsTo relationships
* HasMany relationships (sort of)

---

# Adapter

```js
import { Adapter } from 'ember-graphql-adapter';

export default Adapter.extend({
  endpoint: `${EmberENV.apiBaseUrl}/graph`
});
```

---

# Serializer

```js
import { Serializer } from 'ember-graphql-adapter';

export default Serializer.extend({});
```

---

# Model

```
DS.Model.extend({
  name: DS.attr('string');
});
```

---

# Route

```
model: function() {
  return this.store.findAll('company')
}
```

---

# Query

```
query {
  companies {
    id
    name
  }
}
```

---

# Result

```
{
  "data": {
    "companies": [
      { id: "1", name: "AlphaSights" },
      { id: "2", name: "Heroku" }
    ]
  }
}
```
