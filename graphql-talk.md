# [fit] No *REST* for the Wicked

---

## A gentle introduction to GraphQL

---

* I'm Ju üôáüèª
* I work for [AlphaSights](engineering.alphasights.com)
* We build ambitious apps in Ruby & Ember

---

## What's this GraphQL thing?

---

* A **Graph** **Q**uery **L**anguage
* Invented by Facebook in 2012, now made open
* Powers most of the Facebook iOS and Android apps

---

# A simple example

---

We have a `users` table like this one

```
+----+------+---------------+-----+-----------+
| id | name |    twitter    | age |  country  |
+----+------+---------------+-----+-----------+
|  1 | Ju   | arkh4m        |  29 | Italy     |
|  2 | Will | willrax       | 268 | Australia |
|  3 | Matz | yukihiro_matz |  50 | Japan     |
+----+------+---------------+-----+-----------+
```

---

# Get all users - Query string

```
{
  users {
    id,
    name
  }
}
```

---

# Get all users - JSON response

```
{
  "data": {
    "users": [
      { "id": "1", "name": "Ju" },
      { "id": "2", "name": "Will" },
      { "id": "3", "name": "Matz" }
    ]
  }
}
```

---

# Get one user - Query string

```
{
  user(id: 1) {
    id,
    name
  }
}
```

---

# Get one user - JSON response

```
{
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "id": "1",
      "name": "Ju"
    }
  }
}
```

---

# Create a user - Query string

```
mutation {
  createUser(
    name: "Tom",
    twitter: "tomdale",
    country: "USA"
  ) {
    id,
    name
  }
}
```

---

# Create a user - JSON response

```
{
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "id": "4",
      "name": "Tom"
    }
  }
}
```

---

Now imagine we have a `company` table like this one

```
+----+-------------+---------------+
| id |    name     |     city      |
+----+-------------+---------------+
|  1 | AlphaSights | London        |
|  2 | Heroku      | San Francisco |
+----+-------------+---------------+
```

---

And we add a `company_id` to each user

```
+----+------+---------------+-----+-----------+------------+
| id | name |    twitter    | age |  country  | company_id |
+----+------+---------------+-----+-----------+------------+
|  1 | Ju   | arkham        |  29 | Italy     |          1 |
|  2 | Will | willrax       | 268 | Australia |          1 |
|  3 | Matz | yukihiro_matz |  50 | Japan     |          2 |
+----+------+---------------+-----+-----------+------------+
```

---

# Relationships - Query string

```
{
  user(id: 1) {
    id,
    name,
    company {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

---

# Relationships - JSON response

```
{
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "id": "1",
      "name": "Ju",
      "company": {
        "name": "AlphaSights"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

---

# But why???

---

* Hierarchical
* Product-centric
* Client-specifies queries
* Backwards Compatible
* Structured, Arbitrary Code
* Application-Layer Protocol
* Strongly-typed
* Introspective
